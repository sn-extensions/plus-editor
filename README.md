## Quickstart

Use your browser to see the Plus Editor in action.

1. `yarn` for dependencies
   
2. `grunt` to build

3. Open `index.html` in the browser.

## Local Installation

See the editor in the desktop app and make changes to the code.

1. Use `git clone --recursive` to clone the [plus-editor](https://github.com/sn-extensions/plus-editor) repository from GitHub. Note the importance of `--recursive`, as there is a Summernote submodule that needs to be cloned as well.
   * If the plus-editor repository has already been cloned, switch to the `vendor` folder and run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
   
2. `yarn` for dependencies
   
3. `grunt` to build
